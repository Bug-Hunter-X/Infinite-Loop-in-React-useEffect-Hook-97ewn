This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving an infinite loop caused by incorrectly using the useEffect hook. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. The issue stems from missing dependency array in useEffect, causing the state to update infinitely.  The solution adds a dependency array to control when the effect runs.
